## Installation instructions
Clone the repo and the app should be able to run from the index.html in the browser.

## Approach
The main approach for this game was using an API from Open Trivia Database to get questions and answers for the categories.
The trivia also had different categories to choose from and the number of questions to answer.

## Passing and Failing
To pass the trivia, you will have to answer atlest 8 questions right from each of them except for the science category where you will have to answer at least 6 questions right. After passing/failing, you can choose to restart the trivia or go back to the homepage and select another category.

## Major Hurdles
Some of the biggest hurdles were to keep track of the scores and questions as the user answered them.
Another hurdle was creating conditions that showed whether the user passed or failed based on their scores.
